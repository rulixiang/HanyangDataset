### Description of the dataset
The Wuhan multi-temperature scene (MtS-WH) data set is mainly used for theoretical research and verification of scene change detection methods. Scene change detection is  detecting and analyzing the changes of land-use in a certain area at the scene semantic level.  
This dataset consists of two large-size VHR images, which have a size of 7200x6000 and are respectively acquired by IKONOS sensors in Feb, 2002 and Jun, 2009. The images cover the Hanyang District, Wuhan City, China and contain 4 spectral bands (Blue, Green, Red and Near-Infrared). The spatial resolution of the images is 1m after fusion by the Gram–Schmidt algorithm.  
For each large-size image, we generated 190 scene images as training set and 1920 images as testing set. These images are labeled as following classes:
```
1-parking              2-water             
3-sparse houses        4-dense houses      
5-residential region   6-idle region       
7-vegetation region    8-industrial region 
0-undefined (Not Used)
```
0-undefined represents scene images that are difficult to distinguish the land-use classes and don't participate in the accuracy evaluation.
### Generation of Training Set
We generate training samples by cropping images from typical regions. Training set of each time includes 190 scene images with size of 150x150. It's noticed that training samples of different time do not correspond to the same position.

### Generation of Testing Set
We obtained the scenes from the large image by a non-over lapping grid with a cell size of 150x150. In this way, we generated 1920 (48x40) test scenes for each time point. Then they are categorized to the above classes by visual interpretation.
